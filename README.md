# saveHoggyGame
Online version of the board game for private use.

Firsty: some linguistics.

Since I own the german version of the game but usually code in english, I need a glossary.
So, here it goes (some entries are rather obvious; alas, I am a fan of complete lists.):

Karten - cards:
Held - Hero
Heldenkarten - Hero deck
Heldenkarte - Hero card
Boesewicht - Villain
Ort(skarte) - Location (card)
Dunkle Kuenste Karte - Dark Arts card
Hogwartskarte - Hogwarts card

Marker - Tokens:
Angriffsmarker - Attack token
Einflussmarker - Influence token
Staerke - Health tracker
Die Macht des Boesen Marker - Villain Control


This list should be obsolete at some point.


In the long run:
- User-Controls
- User login
- Server up and running
- fully playable client-side for games 2-7
- Maybe include some container shit
- Add in dlcs 

/Models contains the models for the cards

yet to decide: database or json-files for the cards
